## üîí Security Features

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption algorithm
- **Cryptographic Randomness**: Secure key and nonce generation using Python's `secrets` module
- **Chunk-based Processing**: Handles large files efficiently without loading entirely into memory
- **No Key Storage**: Encryption keys are never stored on the server
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of file uploads and encryption keys
- **Secure File Handling**: Uses secure filename handling to prevent path traversal attacks

## üé® Design Philosophy

This tool follows a **minimal and professional** design approach:

- **Clean Typography**: System fonts for native appearance
- **Minimal Color Palette**: Professional blue-gray (#2c3e50) and muted grays
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Tab-based navigation for clear workflow
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform spacing and padding throughout
- **Subtle Interactions**: Clean hover states and transitions

## üîß Technical Details

### Encryption Process
1. File is read in 64KB chunks for memory efficiency
2. Each chunk is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a unique nonce
3. Encrypted data is structured with length prefixes for robust parsing
4. Output can be saved as Base64-encoded text or raw binary

### API Endpoints
- `GET /` - Serves the main interface
- `GET /generate-key` - Generates a new encryption key
- `POST /encrypt` - Encrypts uploaded files
- `POST /decrypt` - Decrypts uploaded files

## üö® Security Considerations

- **Keep your encryption keys safe**: Without the key, encrypted files cannot be recovered
- **Use strong, unique keys**: Always generate new keys for different encryption sessions
- **Secure key storage**: Consider using a password manager or secure offline storage
- **File size limits**: Default maximum file size is 100MB (configurable in app.py)
